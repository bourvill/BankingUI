#  BankingUI with SwiftUI

## Inspiration

As I continue my journey on learning and mastering SwiftUI I came across Ghani's nice wallet / banking UI and decided to recreate it. It isn't 100% pixel to pixel perfect, but 
my goal was to focus on SwiftUI concepts and strategies rather than perfection. I had a lot fun making this and just as many "ah ha" moments.
